Create a script structure inspired by the style of viral YouTube stories in the form of a personal account, with a narrative divided into 5 chapters of approximately 10,000 characters each with Kishōtenketsu. These chapters will serve only as a construction guide, only make the skeleton of the script, and should not be explicitly divided in the final text. The story should be intense, emotional and engaging, with family conflicts, betrayals, toxic relationships, injustices and turning points. The focus is to build a realistic journey, with personal growth of the protagonist and a satisfying “karma” ending. It is extremely important to hold the climax for the end of the story, the most anticipated and awaited outcome should only be made at the end of the last chapter.

The structure should follow a classic model of increasing tension, such as Kishōtenketsu, adapted to the style of “contemporary urban mini-fables” — with an engaging beginning, evident conflict, surprising twist and ending with a clear lesson or emotional reflection.

The script should have a constant rhythm, without stagnant sections, and with increasing emotional tension. All major revelations should only happen at the end, with an unexpected twist and clear consequences. The conclusion should be emotional, satisfying and closed, without leaving any loose ends. The tone should be that of a real story, as if the character were telling their story directly to the audience, with simple, emotional and intense sentences — like in the viral videos narrated in the first person on YouTube. Use colloquial language, for all audiences, but without slang.

Exciting and realistic stories can address themes that reflect people's daily lives and their emotional complexities, including tense family relationships, overcoming losses, health challenges, social conflicts, personal growth, ethical dilemmas and resilience in adversity. To enrich the narrative with elements from acclaimed soap operas and series, you can include passionate conflicts, romantic betrayals, family secrets revealed at critical moments, rivalries between friends or relatives, disputes over inheritances, forbidden loves, intrigues in the workplace, and the struggle for power in control dynamics. In addition, themes such as revenge, unexpected reconciliations, sacrifices for love and redemption after serious mistakes are capable of intensifying dramas, captivating the audience by exploring human emotions in their rawest and most impactful essence, tense family relationships, romantic betrayal, secrets, social contempt, underestimation, emotional revenge, personal rediscovery, and silent overcoming. Use real names and common American settings to generate identification. Nothing supernatural.

The story should contain multiple characters with clear motivations, complex relationships and transformations throughout the plot. Use real settings, believable names and situations that seem possible to happen to anyone. The main climax and the most impactful revelation should only happen in the eighth chapter, with a striking, emotionally satisfying and well-rounded ending — without leaving any loose ends.

The focus is to create stories of high narrative quality, but with accessible and emotional language, adapted to the broad YouTube audience. Generate only the structure of the story, the skeleton. Do not write the text yet. Do not use canvas.

You can take inspiration from modern soap opera structures and realistic drama series, such as “This Is Us”, “Grey’s Anatomy”, “Maid”, “Virgin River” — but adapted to the format of a story told on YouTube. Do not use the editing box (canvas).
