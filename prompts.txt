Create the first chapter of the story that will be narrated in video format for YouTube with at least 10,000 characters. The text should be written in the first person, with clear, emotional and fluid language, as if the character were venting to the viewer. Do not use a literary style. The introduction should last 30 seconds, 500 characters and contain a strong emotional hook (a question, a shocking sentence, or a part of the twist) to keep the audience hooked until the end.

The text should seem real, intimate and full of details that create identification with the audience. Avoid formalities, do not use complex metaphors. Show scenes and emotions naturally, like someone telling a difficult story from their own life.

Create an introduction of up to 30 seconds for a storytelling video on YouTube, based on the title. The introduction should be written in a dramatic and emotional tone, with short sentences and an engaging rhythm. Start with the most tense or revolting moment of the story — something that grabs attention from the first sentence. Then, quickly explore the central conflict with strong visual elements. Use emotional triggers such as humiliation, injustice, revenge or overcoming. End with a twist or partial revelation that arouses curiosity and makes the viewer want to keep watching. The style focuses on popular and engaging narrative. Avoid revealing the ending.

Example: It was supposed to be just another ordinary day at school... until the police chief came in shouting, pointing his finger and humiliating the janitor. A black, hard-working man, in front of dozens of students. No one believed what they heard. But minutes later, the patrol cars started arriving. And they weren't local. The FBI cordoned off the building. And what they discovered inside that school changes everything.

Then, add a single, direct and quick call asking the audience to comment on the city from where they are watching, in a natural and short way.

Use long, well-rounded paragraphs, maintaining a continuous rhythm. Avoid loose sentences, poetry style or short fragments to create dramatic impact. The impact should come from the story itself, not from the form.

Remember that you should only wrap up the main plot in the last chapter, making the most important revelations and giving the characters a satisfying ending with a climax and twists.

The chapter should end naturally, without forced transitional or suspenseful sentences, as the story continues in the next chapter. Don't use artificial cliffhangers, just let the flow flow organically.

You can take inspiration from modern soap opera structures and realistic drama series, such as “This Is Us”, “Grey’s Anatomy”, “Maid”, “Virgin River” — but adapted to the format of a story told on YouTube.

You don't need to put labels in the text, for example "CTA:". Write the final text to be narrated, without these topics and divisions, just the text that will be narrated.

Continue the story in an emotional, intimate, and direct style, as if it were a real first-person outburst. The tone should be the same as the previous chapter: fluid narrative, accessible language, and constant emotional tension.

Do not use broken sentences, do not break the text into short phrases or single words; instead, write the text only in long paragraphs, divided into paragraphs, never in small lines alone.

The chapter should delve deeper into the protagonist's conflicts and emotions. Clearly show the dilemmas she faces, the disappointments, doubts, suspicions, and difficult decisions. The protagonist should evolve emotionally with each chapter. Introduce clues, tensions, and small shocks, but hold the main revelation for the end of the last chapter.

Avoid literary phrases or sophisticated style. Keep everything natural, like someone telling their story with painful and real details.

Do not use the editing box (canvas).

The end of each chapter should happen naturally, without phrases like “little did she know what was coming next” or “but everything was about to change”. Do not force cliffhangers or gratuitous suspense. Just end the section as if the conversation will continue in the next chapter.

The chapter should have about 10,000 characters and end with a strong hook for the next one. Make chapter 2

Create the final chapter of the story, with about 10,000 characters. This chapter should contain the emotional climax, the most important revelation of the plot and the resolution of the conflicts.

Don’t use broken sentences, don’t break the text into short phrases or single words. Instead, the text should be full-bodied, with long paragraphs, without loose sentences or artificial constructions that make an impact.

The narrative continues in the first person, with simple, direct and emotional language. The protagonist should have her redemption in a clear and satisfactory way. It could be a moment of silent revenge, emotional release or unexpected recognition.

The ending should give a sense of emotional justice or “karma”, generating a powerful conclusion. It doesn’t have to be “happily ever after”, but it should leave the audience with the feeling that she won in her own way. You can take inspiration from modern soap opera structures and realistic drama series, such as “This Is Us”, “Grey’s Anatomy”, “Maid”, “Virgin River” — but adapted to the format of a story told on YouTube.

At the end, add a single CTA to comment on a specific word that symbolizes the story, with a brief reason for the comment. Then, indicate that there is another video on the screen with a similar story.
